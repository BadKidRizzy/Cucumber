    Then the result will not display the "<Occupation Name>" for the selected STEM discipline
    
    Examples: 
        | Occupation Name               |
        | Actuaries                      |
        | Environmental Economists       |
        | Mathematical Technicians       |


  Scenario Outline: The user should be able to filter the search by multi-disciplinary
    Given the user from Home Page navigate to Occupations search Page
    When the user just select "multi-disciplinary" from STEM discipline
    And the user search for an occupation by "<Occupation Name>"
    Then the result will just display the "<Occupation Name>" for the selected STEM discipline

    When the user select everything but "multi-disciplinary" from STEM discipline
    Then the result will not display the "<Occupation Name>" for the selected STEM discipline
    
    Examples:
        | Occupation Name               |
        | Accountants                    |
        | Video Game Designers           |
        | Anthropologists                |
