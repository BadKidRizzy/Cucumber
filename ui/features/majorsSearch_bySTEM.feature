Feature: The user should be able to filter the major search by STEM discipline

  @smoke_test
  Scenario: The system should provide filters and reset for STEM discipline  
    Given the user from Home Page navigate to Majors search Page
    Then all STEM discipline filters should be unchecked by default 

    When the user select Science
    Then the Science filter would be selected

    When the user select Technology
    Then the Technology filter would be selected

    When the user select Engineering from STEM disciplinary
    Then the Engineering from STEM disciplinary filter would be selected

    When the user select Mathematics
    Then the Mathematics filter would be selected

    When the user select Multi-disciplinary 
    Then the Multi-disciplinary  filter would be selected

    When the user select the STEM discipline reset button
    Then all STEM discipline filters should be unchecked


  Scenario: The system should provide "Science" filters for STEM discipline
    Given the user from Home Page navigate to Majors search Page
    When the user select Science
    Then the system will display the below major name for the selected STEM discipline
