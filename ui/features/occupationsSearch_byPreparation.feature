Feature: The user should be able to filter the search result by preparation needed

  @smoke_test
  Scenario: The system should provide Some, Medium, Considerable preparation filters and a reset for preparation needed
    Given the user from Home Page navigate to Occupations search Page
    When the user select "Some preparation" from preparation needed
    Then the "Some preparation" filter would be selected from preparation needed

    When the user select "Medium preparation" from preparation needed
    Then the "Medium preparation" filter would be selected from preparation needed

    When the user select "Considerable preparation" from preparation needed
    Then the "Some preparation" filter would be selected from preparation needed

    When the user select the preparation needed reset button
    Then the preparation needed filters should be unselected

  @regression
  Scenario: The system should provide same name for Medium, Considerable and Extensive preparation filters when hover over or select that filter 
    Given the user from Home Page navigate to Occupations search Page
    When the user select "Medium preparation" from preparation needed
